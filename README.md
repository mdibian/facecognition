# Facecognition

Facecognition is an application that allows you to detect faces on an image through an artificial intelligence API. The project is pretty simple and was intended only to put some web development technologies into practice, you can register, sign-in and send an image right away!

## Technologies

The project was made with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a relational database solution, and the back-end part can be found here in [facecognition-api](https://github.com/mdibian/facecognition-api).

## Run the project locally

To initiate and run the project front-end part locally on your machine, run the command below to install all dependencies
 ```
 npm install
 ``` 
 
After this, you can initate the project by running
 ```
 npm start
 ```
 
In order to get the back-end working properly you'll have to head to the [facecognition-api](https://github.com/mdibian/facecognition-api) repository and follow the instructions as well.

## Usage example
Well, It will count your entries too, so, do your best! :)
(It seems to detect anime faces too, how cool is that?)
