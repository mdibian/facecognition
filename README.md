# Facecognition

Facecognition is an application that allows you send an image through an artificial intelligence API which tries to detect human faces. The project was intended only to put some web development technologies into practice.

## Technologies

The project front-end was made with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). The back-end was made with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database, and can be found here in [facecognition-api](https://github.com/mdibian/facecognition-api).

## Run Project Locally 

To initiate and run the project locally on your machine, run the command below to install all dependencies.
 ```
 npm install
 ``` 
 
After this, you can initate the project by running
 ```
 npm start
 ```
 
  Remembering that this repository contains the front-end part only.
